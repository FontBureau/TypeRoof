<p>Successor of Video Proof (original README below).</p>
<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>The latest (and final) version that has evolved from Video Proof and Variable Type Tools:</p>
<p><a href="https://fontbureau.github.io/TypeRoof/">https://fontbureau.github.io/TypeRoof/</a></p>
<h2>Minimal Shell</h2>
<p>The work in progress <em>minimal shell</em> version. It has a data driven and state<br>
managed approach. It’s minimal in so far as that the shell itself only provides<br>
infrastructure like boot strapping, loading of shared assets, serialization.<br>
The applications (“Layouts”) are loaded as separate modules. This includes<br>
an animation editor as a proof of concept:</p>
<p>Go to <a href="https://fontbureau.github.io/TypeRoof/shell">https://fontbureau.github.io/TypeRoof/shell</a> then select <em>Layout: Stage and Actors</em></p>
<p>Screen recordings of animations made with the <em>Stage and Actors</em> editor: <a href="https://fontbureau.github.io/TypeRoof/docs/animation-screenrecordings.html">https://fontbureau.github.io/TypeRoof/docs/animation-screenrecordings.html</a></p>

<h1>Video Proof</h1>
<p>Experimental tools for creating animated proofs for variable fonts.</p>
<p><a href="https://videoproof.graphicore.de/">https://videoproof.graphicore.de/</a><br>
SOME DEVELOPERS need more sophisticated composition tools for variable fonts; To exercise, proof and, annotate, demo and share</p>
<p>CREATE AND DEMONSTRATE options for integration of registered and parametric axes with the value systems and processes of composition and composers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Proof and adjust the integration via a combination of css, js, and Ui developments</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Analyze both visually and with filtering and sorting of the data-rich CSS environment now available</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Annotate issues on glyp, gvar, gpos and other font tables uses with css, js in compostion.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Share via fonts, css, js, urls of still and motion proofs notes and code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this should be done with the option of a limited number of inputs from the user, or have access to all composition variables.</p>
<p>Typetools was developed as a web-based proofing tool for variable fonts made to test fonts during development and in simulated web use for static instances of fonts.</p>

<p>The variable fonts it was made to test, include those made to  specifications for additional registration of axes proposed by TN, summarized here as containing parametric and registered axes.</p>

<p>(Publication Site link: <a href="https://variationsguide.typenetwork.com">https://variationsguide.typenetwork.com</a>)</p>
<p>Development showed users needed the composition formats, sliders, and other options that are currently evident and defined in the user documentation.</p>
<p>(Publication link: <a href="https://variationsguide.typenetwork.com">https://variationsguide.typenetwork.com</a> !! Put actual user guide link here ¡¡</p>
<p>User experience showed a repeated user journey including use of sliders to examine a variable font’s designspace, and the need to capture and communicate locations and ranges of design space within the designspace.</p>
<p>Other develpers have confirmed the usefulness of tagging “KEYFRAMES” of varible instances ranges relative to composition of responsive pages.</p>
<p>Development is only a month old and all development is only a month old and all big reports and suggestions are welcome.</p>
