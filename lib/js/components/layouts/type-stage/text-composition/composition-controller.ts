/**
 * The task of text composition is divided into two sides of a contract
 * (composition-types.ts; algorithms import only from that module):
 *
 *   - the Host: everything environment-facing (text, fonts, locale,
 *     DOM, time). Host roles are pure where possible; only the
 *     Applicator and the Controller are truly impure.
 *   - the Algorithm: pure composition (CompositionInput -> CompositionResult)
 *
 * Roles within the Host (coordinated by this controller):
 *
 *   - Segmenter (pure pass): paragraph {text, styleSpans} -> segments
 *     + break opportunities; splits at style boundaries and UAX#14
 *     (https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/)  break points. Hard
 *     breaks (e.g. <br>, newline) separate the paragraph into LOGICAL
 *     paragraphs as far as line-breaking is concerned; the Controller
 *     invokes the Algorithm once per logical paragraph — the
 *     Algorithm never sees hard breaks.
 *   - Hyphenator (pure pass, pluggable per language): adds segments
 *     and break points inside words; a hyphenated segment includes the
 *     hyphen glyph in its measured width, so algorithms stay ignorant
 *     of hyphenation. Enabled/disabled as a Host control PRIOR to line
 *     breaking/fitting — it changes the input, not the algorithm.
 *   - Measurer (stateful but deterministic): HarfBuzz shaping and
 *     advance caching in font units (em — size independent, so caches
 *     keyed by (text, font, axes location) stay valid across sizes;
 *     pt conversion at the contract boundary is a pure scaling by
 *     fontSizePt / unitsPerEm); backs all width numbers including the
 *     injected lineWidthAtStep.
 *   - Treatment Planner (pure logic over configuration): derives the
 *     per-candidate normalized step scale (0 = natural width, -1 =
 *     maximum narrowing, +1 = maximum widening; the two directions
 *     are not symmetric in physical width) and the step->width
 *     mapping from the per-font-location treatment tables, relative
 *     to the font's current axis location. The Measurer turns its
 *     output into the injected width function. What a step applies
 *     physically is policy defined HERE, not in the contract: the
 *     first iteration applies all potentials in parallel, axes
 *     first, then spacing; later iterations may change the order,
 *     proportion or mechanism mix without touching any algorithm.
 *   - Applicator (impure): applies CompositionResult to the DOM —
 *     span-based CSS (the varla-varfo --line-adjust-step pattern):
 *     lines are wrapped in spans and adjustment is set via CSS custom
 *     properties. This leaves the semantics of the document intact
 *     and makes undo a matter of removing the spans. Also resets the
 *     output rendering.
 *   - Controller (this file): lifecycle (start, stop, pause, resume),
 *     dirty-range tracking (on edit, recompose from the first changed
 *     paragraph until breaks re-synchronize, not the whole document),
 *     orchestration of the passes above, algorithm selection.
 *     Logical paragraphs are independent composition units (pure
 *     algorithm, no shared state), so the Controller may parallelize
 *     them across workers, compose lazily (viewport) and recompose
 *     per dirty paragraph.
 *
 * Roles within an Algorithm (compositional, both pure):
 *
 *   - Breaker: chooses break points (strategy varies per algorithm).
 *   - Fitter: given a line candidate, chooses adjustmentStep within
 *     [-1, 1] using lineWidthAtStep. Shared between algorithms.
 *
 * Algorithm milestones (dynamic choice of algorithm is a goal):
 *
 *   1. dummy — proves the infrastructure calling the algorithm works.
 *   2. simple greedy alignment — ragged, greedy line breaking.
 *   3. greedy ragged + hyphenation — same algorithm as 2, richer
 *      input (hyphenation is a Host control, not an algorithm).
 *   4. greedy-fit — the varla-varfo strategy, predictively: greedy
 *      break at natural width; narrow until one more segment fits
 *      (minimal narrowing step); if narrowing pulls nothing up, widen
 *      to fill or leave at max potential. Must remain possible — it
 *      exercises every injected function — but it is a validation
 *      milestone, not the goal.
 *   5. Knuth-Plass++ — the actual target: paragraph-wide optimization
 *      with penalties (already in BreakOpportunity) and badness over
 *      the normalized adjustmentStep as the glue model (one
 *      continuous dimension, its physical meaning being Host policy).
 *
 * INTEGRATION (type-stage):
 *
 *   - Hook point: the DocumentNodesMeta tree (the always-active,
 *     DOM-free meta layer mirroring our metamodel NodeModel — the
 *     source of truth). The Composition Controller is a service
 *     OBSERVING the meta tree, not a renderer: it produces no DOM.
 *     It collects logical paragraphs from textblock nodes (text runs
 *     + style spans via the nodeProperties@ scopes), successive to
 *     the UIDocumentTypeSpecStyler — composition needs the final
 *     computed font/size/axes per run.
 *   - Line width comes from the node-properties (the layout model's
 *     page/column geometry), NEVER from measuring the DOM: we
 *     compose by prediction and then force our lines onto the DOM,
 *     which we control completely.
 *   - Results are published via a composition@<documentNodePath>
 *     protocol (same pattern as nodeProperties@/environment@), so
 *     any renderer can consume them: compose once, apply to multiple
 *     targets (side-by-side view).
 *   - The Applicator role lives in each renderer:
 *       + Viewer (the CENTER PIECE, confirmed feasible by the
 *         varla-varfo demo): the UIDocumentTextRun/UIDocumentElement
 *         attachments wrap lines in spans + CSS custom properties.
 *       + Editor (EXPERIMENTAL, later): a ProseMirror plugin
 *         translating the same CompositionResult into decorations.
 *         PM owns its DOM and does its own line wrapping, so it may
 *         fight us; if it does, the viewer alone is good enough.
 *         Invest only after the viewer is sealed.
 *
 * EXECUTION ORDER / SCHEDULING:
 *
 *   Current cascade (fact): the meta tree updates synchronously,
 *   top-down; a node's nodeProperties scope settles before its
 *   children cascade; the viewer's UIDocumentElement provisions its
 *   TypeSpecStyler before its other widgets; text-run attachments
 *   fill their DOM during their first update. So styles settle
 *   before content DOM is applied, all within one synchronous
 *   cycle. Changes to typeSpecProperties@/nodeProperties@ of an
 *   already-rendered node fire its update — that is the trigger
 *   set for recomposition; no separate dirty-tracking initially.
 *
 *   Hybrid scheduling:
 *     - Initial load: compose before reveal. The viewer renders
 *       the whole article in one controlled moment; keep it hidden
 *       until the first composition@ result per paragraph is
 *       published — no flash of unjustified content.
 *     - Steady state: async, per dirty paragraph. Recomposition
 *       does not block the cascade; the Controller schedules it
 *       after the cycle settles (microtask/idle callback; workers
 *       later, when algorithms get expensive — the Algorithm's
 *       purity makes that move mechanical). A brief moment of
 *       stale justification on edited paragraphs is acceptable
 *       (InDesign does the same).
 *
 *   Wrapping timing: line spans are throwaway — undo is unwrapping,
 *   so the Applicator can wrap/rewrap at any time. Requirement: the
 *   text-run attachment's DOM must exist; an attachment update that
 *   re-applies text invalidates the applied composition (the same
 *   update marks the paragraph dirty, triggering recomposition).
 *
 *   OFF MODE (no compositor): it must always be possible to opt
 *   out of composition entirely and keep today's behavior — the
 *   browser does its own line breaking. Valuable for comparison
 *   (speed, quality) and as a fallback when we fail, e.g. in
 *   environments missing capabilities (no HarfBuzz, no required
 *   APIs). Off mode is the absence of composition@ entries:
 *   renderers consume nothing and apply nothing, so the fallback
 *   costs zero in the applicators.
 *
 *   Staleness via immutable identity (no generation counters):
 *   the Host captures the immutable source objects a
 *   CompositionInput was built from (the narrowest that determine
 *   the input: paragraph node value/payload, settled nodeProperties
 *   — NOT the root state, which would invalidate everything on any
 *   keystroke). The published composition@ entry carries that
 *   source reference; consumers apply a result only if the current
 *   payload is === the captured one. Metamodel immutables are
 *   replaced wholesale on change, so === is a sound and complete
 *   staleness test — race-free async application without locks.
