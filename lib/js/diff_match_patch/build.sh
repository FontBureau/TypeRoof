# Create an JavaScript/ECMAScript Module from the plain JavaScript file.
# This requires the original diff_match_patch as a git submodule (or copy)
# in the root directory:
#     $ git submodule add https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch.git diff-match-patch

# There's a line:
#    '// CLOSURE:begin_strip'
# After that line definitons to the global namespace are attempted.
# Exclude everything after that line.
#
# These lines:
#     'var DIFF_DELETE = -1;'
#     'var DIFF_INSERT = 1;'
#     'var DIFF_EQUAL = 0;'
# Should become:
#     'export const DIFF_DELETE = -1;'
#     'export const DIFF_INSERT = 1;'
#     'export const DIFF_EQUAL = 0;'
# Thus find 'var DIFF_'  and replace with 'export const DIFF_'.
#
# Finally add the line
#     'export default diff_match_patch;'
